DESCRIPTION
***************************************
This is a collection of currently one(!) Python-Script to be run from within FontForge.

If installed properly the new functions are accessible from the Tools Menu

Tools->Interactive Python Shell
    start an interactive python shell, you will have live access to the currently open
    fonts, selection, whatever in your running instance of FontForge.

    The ipython shell will run in a gtk-Window

    paste and run the following line of python code (everything after >>>)
    into the shell to see a list of all open glyphs:
